I bought this 1992 Camaro RS in 2016 from the nephew of the original owner, who took excellent care of it throughout its 125,000 miles. The interior was all original red (no kidding!) with a cheap repaint on the body. I found out firsthand that the “RS” trim stands for “reliably slow” with its 305 TBI truck engine outputting a whopping 170HP.

 While I owned the car, I decided to improve its suspension, braking, and handling. I first installed a “wonder bar,” which ties the two parallel front frame rails together. Then I had subframe connectors welded in. These greatly improved the chassis rigidity and handling. Then, I replaced the entire front suspension including control arms, struts, and steering linkages. I also bought custom laser cut brackets that adapted much larger C5 Corvette brakes to the front wheels.
