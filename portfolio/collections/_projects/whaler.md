I bought a 1967 Boston Whaler Sport 13 in 2014. Although in sound shape, I refinished all of the mahogany with epoxy and varnish, as well as painted the inside of the boat. I also replaced all controls and steering, and fabricated a custom jackplate to raise the outboard out of the water further for bit more top speed. The boat came with a 1980 Mercury 40HP two stroke outboard. As with any outboard of that era, reliability was not its strong suit. I ended up rebuilding the carburetor and chasing down numerous electrical gremlins. All that said, the boat gave me great enjoyment and plenty of fish.
