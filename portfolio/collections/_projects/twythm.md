Back in 2012 when I first learning web development, I had an idea for a website to easily share the song you were listening to on social media. Twitter did not have many rich content types back then (only pictures IIRC), and I thought it would be cool to allow people to share what they were listening to.

Twythm worked by creating a unique link for each song that was searched for and provided metadata on the song such as year, artist, lyrics, and more. Through the Grooveshark API, people could also listen to the song when they visited the page.

It recieved some mild use from 2012 to 2014 and then when Grooveshark shut down, so did Twythm. It was a fun project that taught me how to use APIs, develop web and mobile apps, and create something people liked.
